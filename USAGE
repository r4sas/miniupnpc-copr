UPnPc usage
===== =====

From the command line:

For listing all forwarded ports through UPnP in the current router:

upnpc -l

For adding a new port forward rule to the current router, for example, 
to forward tcp traffic on port 81 to internal ip port 80:

upnpc -a 10.0.0.3 80 81 tcp

You don't have to worry about overwriting previous rules, because the
new ones will replace existing ones. 

If upnpc fails to add the rule, it may be because the port was added
before in a static forwarding rule.

Traffic on port 1900 is blocked by default on Fedora, and even if 
you open it, all traffic gets blocked because the nature of SSDP protocol.
You will need to open incoming traffic from udp port 1900, because the
packet sent to the router was from YourIP to 239.255.255.250 and the answer
sent by the router is from RouterIP to YourIP. As a result, conntrack 
module can't track that kind of traffic and blocks all incoming answers.
To add the iptables rule manually, do the following:

iptables -I INPUT -p udp --sport 1900 -j ACCEPT

You may also add this custom rule to system-config-firewall.

I hope you enjoy.
